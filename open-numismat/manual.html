<h2 id="sec1">1 Introduction</h2>
<h3>1.1 Description</h3>
<p>OpenNumismat is a handy and reliable application designed for collectors of coins and coin collectors, to create a numismatic collection.
<p>With OpenNumismat you will be able to create, organize, and manage your own catalogs of coins with detailed descriptions and photos for each item.
<p>OpenNumismat is distributed in full absolutely free. The source code is licensed under the GPL-3.0 and available at <a href="https://github.com/OpenNumismat/open-numismat" target="blank_">GitHub</a>.
<p>Official website is located at <a href="http://opennumismat.github.io" target="blank_">http://opennumismat.github.io</a>.

<h3>1.2 Features of the implementation</h3>
<p>OpenNumismat is based on the PySide6 library with the SQLite database engine to store the data collection, which allowed to achieve lightness and responsiveness of the interface and cross-platform.
<p>A complete list of the used components and libraries is available <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenNumismat/open-numismat/master/requirements.txt" target="blank_">here</a>.
<p>Icons used in the interface, based on the <a href="http://led24.de/iconset/" target="blank_">LED Icon Set</a> v1.0, Soft Scraps Icons by <a href="http://deleket.deviantart.com/" target="blank_">deleket</a> and <a href="http://www.famfamfam.com" target="blank_">Flag icons</a>.

<p>The coin image in the Table of coins is automatically generated from the obverse and reverse images.

<h3>3.2 Editing a coin</h3>
<p>To edit the coin data, you need to double-click on the required coin, right-click on the desired coin and select <i>Edit...</i>, select the coin and press Enter key or select the <i>Record->Edit...</i> menu. After that, the Edit dialog will be opened, described in 3.1.

<h3>3.3 Clone coins</h3>
<p>To quickly add a similar coin, you can use cloning. To do this, right click on the coin and select Clone. The Edit window filled with information about the new coin will open, edit the required fields and save.
<p>You can also copy (using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Ins</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>) the existing coin and paste it (by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Ins</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>) - the Edit dialog will also open.
<br>A copied coin or coin group (see below) can be inserted into a third-party application (for example, MS Excel or Notepad). In this case, when inserting into a third-party application, only text fields (without images) will be copied.
<p>You can also add a new coin with pre-filled fields from the Tree. To do this, right click on the Tree element and select <i>Add new coin...</i>. In the opened Edit dialog all common fields for coins corresponding to this element will be filled.

<h3>3.4 Editing Multiple Coins</h3>
<p>Sometimes you need to change some fields at once for several coins. To do this, select the required coins (to select several coins, use the click with the <kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key pressed, to select all the coins, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>), right-click on the selected coin group and select <i>Multi edit...</i> or the <i>Record->Edit...</i> menu.
<br>In the opened Edit dialog, all matching fields for the selected coin group will be filled. Each field will have a checkbox that allows or denies the application of the field value to the whole group of coins when saving:
<p><img src="/images/manual/multi_edit.png"></p>
<p>Also, group editing is available from the Tree - right-click on the tree element and select <i>Edit coins...</i>.

<h3>3.5 Removing</h3>
<p>You can remove coins from the collection one by one or by a group. To delete, select the <i>Record->Delete</i> menu, right-click on the selected coin or coin group and select <i>Delete</i> or press the <kbd>Del</kbd> key.
<p>Removed coins are removed from the collection at once and can not be repaired - be careful.

<h2 id="sec4">4 View Coins</h2>
<h3>4.1 Table of coins</h3>
<p>The Table of coins is the central element of the application, serves to display coin data according to those selected with the settings.
<p>The number and location of fields can be set in the <i>List->Select columns...</i> menu or by right-clicking on the table header and selecting <i>Select columns...</i>.
<p><img src="/images/manual/columns.png"></p>
<p>In the opened dialog, it is necessary to mark the fields of interest. Dragging the names of fields with a mouse can change the location of the fields relative to each other. You can also drag field headers directly into the coin table. Clicking on the field header sorts the table according to the selected field.
<p>You can control the width of a column in a table by expanding the border of the column heading with the mouse or by right-clicking on the header and selecting <i>Adjust size</i>.

<h3>4.2 Image Panel</h3>
<p>This panel displays images tied to the coin. At the bottom of the panel are checkboxes allowing you to control the number of simultaneously displayed images.
<br>Double-clicking opens the imagen in the Image Editor (see 9) or in the standard image viewer of your OS. When you hover your mouse over an image, a unique image name is displayed, if it was specified when editing the coin.

<h3>4.3 Filter</h3>
<p>Using the menu in the column headings of the table, you can filter coins by the value of the fields.
<p><img src="/images/manual/filter.png"></p>
<p>The Filter menu contains all column values. Marked values will be displayed, the rest will be hidden. To mark all items or remove marks from all values, select <i>(All)</i>. At the top of the menu is a field that allows you to filter out the menu values.
<p>To reset all filters in the current list, click the <i>Clear all filters</i> button on the toolbar:
<p><img src="/images/manual/clear_filters.png"></p>
<h3>4.4 Tree</h3>
<p>The tree on the left side of the application window allows you to group coins by field values. When selecting a tree element, the coins corresponding to the selected value are displayed in the table.
<p>To customize the tree, right-click on the tree element and select <i>Customize tree...</i>:
<p><img src="/images/manual/tree.png"></p>
<p>In the opened dialog you can change the structure of the tree by dragging the elements with the mouse. Items that are dragged from right to left are added to the end of the tree. Dragging from left to right removes items from the tree. To merge two fields (for example, <i>Value+Unit</i>), hold down the Ctrl key while dragging.

<h3>4.5 Lists</h3>
<p>The lists allow you to have several independent collection views. Each list stores its own settings for fields, columns, filters and tree. This allows the lists to be used as permanent filters.
<p>Add a new list by clicking on the <i>List->New...</i> menu or by double-clicking on the list panel (from the empty space next to the headings of the existing lists) and entering the name of the new list. You can also create a copy of the existing list by right-clicking on the source list and selecting <i>Clone</i>.
<p>You can change the name of the list by selecting the <i>List->Rename...</i> menu or by right-clicking on the list title and selecting <i>Rename...</i>.
<p>Closed lists are not deleted and are available in the <i>List->Open</i> menu. To permanently delete private lists, select the <i>List->Open->Remove all</i> menu.

<h3>4.6 Status Bar</h3>
<p>At the bottom of the application window there is a status bar showing the name and path to the collection file, the total number of coins in the collection and in the current Table of coins, the number of coins in the selected group.
<p><img src="/images/manual/status.png"></p>

<h2 id="sec5">5 Managing a collection file</h2>
<p>The collection file is a regular file with the extension .db and stores all data about the collection including images other than references (see 7). You can copy, move, delete and rename it by means of your OS.

<h3>5.1 Creating/Opening</h3>
<p>To create a new collection, select the menu <i>File->New...</i>. In the dialog that opens, select the location and name of the new collection file.
<p>To open an existing collection file, select the <i>File->Open...</i> menu and select the desired file. You can also associate collection files (for example, if you select the appropriate option when installing the application) and open them automatically when you "call" from the file manager.
<br>The File menu displays up to 5 recently opened collections available for quick opening.

<h3>5.2 Backup</h3>
<p>To prevent data loss of the collection due to hardware, software, human errors, as well as the work of malicious programs, it is recommended to perform a backup. To create a backup copy of the collection, select the menu <i>File->Backup</i>. This will create a copy of the current collection with the date and time stamp added (for example, demo_171025115112.db for the copy made at 11:51:12 on 25/10/2017) in the directory specified in the settings. To restore the data, just rename the backup file by deleting the time stamp. You can also copy the collection file using your OS.
<p>Note: It is recommended to store backups on a physical medium other than the worker. Choosing a cloud storage, such as Dropbox, can be a good option. It is also important to make backup copies on a regular basis, before or after making a large number of changes (see 8.4).

<h3>5.3 Vacuum</h3>
<p>In view of the peculiarities of SQLite implementation, which provides storage of collection data, memory is not automatically released when data is deleted in the collection file. Over time, this can lead to an increase in the size of the collection file, its fragmentation and slowdown of the application. If necessary, you can reduce the size of the collection file by releasing unnecessary "empty" space by selecting the <i>File->Vacuum</i> menu.

<h3>5.4 Password</h3>
<p>In the menu <i>File->Set password...</i> you can set the password that will be requested each time the collection is opened.
<p><img src="/images/manual/password.png"></p>
<p>Note: data encryption is not carried out, so the password protection cannot be considered complete.

<h3>5.5 Synchronization</h3>
<p>Changes made in multiple copies of a collection file can be merged safely with the menu <i>File->Synchronize...</i>.
<p>The most important properties of the synchronization algorithm:
<ul>
<li>All new entries will be added (detected by Created field) to opened collection.
<li>Entries with the same value of ID and Created field will be updated when Updated field value is less in opened collection.
</ul>

<h3>5.6 Importing</h3>
<p>OpenNumismat allows you to import data from collections creted in another software (MS Excel, CoinManage, Collection Studio and Tellico)
or sites (<a href="https://colnect.com/">Colnect</a>, <a href="https://en.numista.com/">Numista</a> and uCoin.net).
<p>For importing from MS Excel select the menu <i>File-&gt;Import-&gt;Excel</i> and select the source file.
After that, the dialog for assigning fields with the first 10 coins from the source file will be opened:

<h3>6.1 Generating reports</h3>
<p>The application supports the generation of reports on templates. You can edit existing ones or create your own report templates.
<br>The generated report can be printed or saved in HTML, PDF, MS Word formats from the Preview dialog.
<p>To create a report, you need to select the coins for which data will be included in the report and open the Preview dialog by selecting the <i>Report->Report...</i> menu:
<p><img src="/images/manual/report_preview.png"></p>
<p>In the Preview dialog, you can select a report template (the left list on the toolbar), control the preview mode, and print or save the report to a file of the desired format (right buttons on the toolbar).
<p>Note: Preview dialog use old library for generating HTML. So reports in preview may be corrupted and do not match the view in modern browsers. Also it may crash when generating large reports (more than 100 coins). For viewing and printing you can use Quick report (see 6.2) for open report in your browser.

<h3>6.2 Quick Report</h3>
<p>By selecting the <i>Report->View in browser</i> menu, you can quickly view the report for the selected coins in HTML format.
<p><img src="/images/manual/report.png"></p>
<p>For a quick report, used the template set in the Settings dialog as the <i>Default template</i>.

<h3>6.3 Editing Templates</h3>
<p>The engine for generating template reports is based on the open-source Jinja2 library.
<p>User templates should be placed into Documents folder (usually C:\Users\user\Documents\OpenNumismat\templates). Each template is in a separate subfolder, the name of which is used as the template name.
<p>The reports are generated in UTF-8 encoding and, accordingly, the templates should be in the same encoding. Therefore, for editing templates it is recommended to use, for example, Notepad++.
<p>Attention: when deleting, reinstalling or updating the application, user templates can be lost. Always back up your templates, if you make changes to them, before these actions.

<h3>6.5 Exporting the Table of coins</h3>
<p>OpenNumismat allows you to save the current Table of coins with all applied filters and sorting in a separate file in MS Excel, HTML or CSV format (Note: in the current implementation, images are not exported).
<p>You can export the Table of coins in the menu <i>Report->Save current list...</i>. In the opened dialog select the file name, the required format and save the file.

<h3>6.6 Statistics</h3>
<p>Also for create any diagram and calculating statistics you can use MS Excel. Copy coins that you need from OpenNumismat to MS Excel or export Table of coins to MS Excel file (see 6.5) and use its functionality.

<h3>6.7 Summary</h3>

<h2 id="sec7">7 References</h2>
<p>References make it easy to enter data when editing a coin, and also add icons (such as flags) to the data display. References are available for the following fields: Region, Country, Period, Ruler, Unit, Mint, Series, Grade, Material, Shape, Quality, Edge, Rarity, ObvRev, Type, Defect, Place (purchase or sale).
<p>Editing references is available from the Edit dialog:
<p><img src="/images/manual/ref_edit2.png"></p>
<p>or from menu <i>Reference->Edit...</i>:
<p><img src="/images/manual/ref_edit1.png"></p>
<p>Right-clicking on the entry in the directory opens access to adding or deleting the item's icon:
<p><img src="/images/manual/ref_menu.png"></p>
<p>References for Country, Period, Ruler, Unit, Mint, Series is a cross-references and their updating is available only if you select the value of the base field that exists in the reference. For example, to add a new mint, you should first select an existing country.
<p>The <i>Sort</i> check box sorts all the entries in the directory, otherwise all items will be displayed in the order they were entered.
<p>To quickly fill references with entered data from the collection, select the <i>Reference->Fill from collection</i> menu.
<p>By default, references are stored in a separate file with a .ref extension, which can be copied, renamed or deleted by means of your OS. The path to the references file can be specified in the Settings dialog.
<p>Also you can attach current reference to a collection file. Select <i>Reference->Attach current reference</i> for attaching or <i>Reference->Detach current reference</i> for remove reference from collection and use default from Settings.
